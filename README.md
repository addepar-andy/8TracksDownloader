A javascript extension that extends the functionality of 8Tracks.com by allowing individual song downloads among other improvements.

<h1>Installation Guide</h1>
<h2>Firefox</h2>
<p>Install the Greasemonkey addon and go to the <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/125828">userscript page</a></p>

<h2>Chrome</h2>
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jloifebflohjhadfijcelkkghmmoknfg" target="_blank">Download from the Chrome Web Store</a>
<p>The latest version of Chrome does not allow you to install userscripts from userscripts.org.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on pushing this to the Google Chrome Web Store, but until then here is a guide to help you get started</p>

<p><b>The method below is deprecated, you should download it from the Chrome Web Store via the link above.</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Download <a href="https://raw.github.com/Overload119/8TracksDownloader/master/script.js">manifest.json</a> and <a href="https://raw.github.com/Overload119/8TracksDownloader/master/manifest.json">script.js</a>.To download it to your computer, click the Wrench icon on the top right and click <b>Save page as.</b></li>
  <li>Now create a new empty folder and move the files you just downloaded into it.</li>
  <li>Go back to Chrome, at the top right click the Wrench icon, go to <b>Tools</b> then <b>Extensions</b></li>
  <li>Checkmark <b>Developer Mode</b> at the top</li>
  <li>Click <b>Load unpacked extension</b></li>
  <li>Browse for the folder you had created earlier</li>
  <li>That's it! Refresh an 8Tracks page to see the extension working.</li>
</ul>
